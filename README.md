# Basic LLM projects
- Added plots for embeddings using glove
- Prompt Engineering on FLan-T5 model for text summarization
- use gpt 2 for text generation
- used LLaMa model for text generation
- used distilgpt2 as smaller model to use

# Techniques to run complex and heavy LLM models on my mac
- Tried to used quantization for running complex LLM models. 
- Tried to use Mac's Metal Performance shaders for running huge models like LLaMa.

# Basic LLM projects
- Added plots for embeddings using glove
- Prompt Engineering on FLan-T5 model for text summarization
- use gpt 2 for text generation
- used LLaMa model for text generation
- used distilgpt2 as smaller model

# Techniques to run complex and heavy LLM models on macs
- Tried to used quantization for running complex LLM models. 
- Tried to use Mac's Metal Performance shaders for running huge models like LLaMa and Bloom.

# Using Fine tuning Techniques
- I will be using Peft Techniques (mainly LoRa and soft prompting) to imporve the performace without using a lot of compute resources

Using dataset from hugging face

Utilizing cluster from Databricks clusters

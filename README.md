# Basic LLM projects
- Added plots for embeddings using Glove model.
- Prompt Engineering on FLan-T5 model for text summarizations
- use gpt 2 for text generation
- used LLaMa model for text generation
- used distilgpt2 as smaller model

# Techniques to run complex and heavy LLM models on macs
- Tried to used quantization for running complex LLM models. 
- Tried to use Mac's Metal performance shaders for running huge models like LLaMa and Bloom.

# Using Fine tuning Techniques
- I will be using Peft Techniques (mainly LoRa and soft prompting) to imporve the performace without using a lot of compute resources

Using dataset from hugging face

Utilizing cluster from Databricks 

I am going to use API calls inside the application for seamless interaction.


**Experiment 2:**
I have made API call for making the use of chatgpt 3.5. By doing this I have generated lyrics to a song.

**Experiment 3:**
I am going to train tabular data to make predictions on it
